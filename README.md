A app that keeps track of your to-do actions, you can add any number of tasks to it, search those tasks, click on the checkbox to complete the task, and filter using buttons like active tasks, completed tasks and all the tasks. 

To complete a todo, user will check the checkbox. Completed todo should be grey and ~~stike~~ style  

Active todos are todos that haven't been completed.

The design should look like the image below
